When you first download and install it, R is an already very powerful and versatile programming language aimed mainly at those who want to do statistical analysis of data. However a major strength of it and other open source software is that anyone can contribute to their development. In the case of R this has led to it being augmented by the creation of so-called packages, of which there are now thousands, from which you can pick and choose and add to your instance of R whenever you want. Each packag comprises additional functions and/or data sets Often these are aimed at particular specialisms that not everyone wants

This code chunk will install on your machine a list of packages, unless you already have them installed.

As time goes on this list may be updated (or you may update it!), so it will be worth coming back to this script and running it again, from time to time.

```{r}
list.of.packages <- c("tidyverse",
                      "lubridate",
                      "here",
                      "readxl",
                      "googlesheets4",
                      "janitor",
