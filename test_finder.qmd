You can either use this [text version of a test finder](figures/test_finder_and_help.pdf), taken from [@gilbert2017]

or use this flowchart to see which test is appropriate for your study design and your data:

```{mermaid, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE}

  A{Difference or Trend Question?} --> B[Trend]
  B --> B2{Are you testing for degree of associationor are you trying to make predictions?}
  B2 --> B33[Association:Test for correlation coefficient Pearson or  Spearman's Rank]
  B2 --> B44[Predictions: Simple linear regression]
  A --> C[Difference]
  C --> C22{Do you have replicates?}
  C22 --> C22Y[Yes]

  C23 --> C23Y[Yes]
  C23 --> C23N[N0]

Now go to whichever chapter of this book covers the test you need.
