Use this flowchart to see which test is appropriate for your study design and your data:

```{mermaid, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
flowchart TD
  A{Difference or Trend \nQuestion?} --> B[Trend]
  B --> B2{Are you testing for \ndegree of association\nor are you trying \nto make predictions?}
  B2 --> B33[Association:\n\nTest for\n correlation coefficient\nPearson or \n Spearman's Rank]
  B2 --> B44[Predictions:\n\nSimple linear regression]
  A --> C[Difference]
  C --> C22{Do you have replicates?}
  C22 --> C22Y[Yes]
  C22 --> C22N[No]
  C22N --> C23{Do you have count data?}
  C23 --> C23Y[Yes]
  C23 --> C23N[N0]
  C23Y --> C24(Chi square test:\nGoodness of fit\nor\nTest of independence)
  C23N --> C25[These data cannot be analysed]
  C22Y --> D{How many factors?}
  D --> F[Two or more]
  F --> F2{Independent\nsamples?}
  F2 --> F2Y[Yes]
  F2 --> F2N[No]
  F2Y --> F22Y(n-way ANOVA)
  F2N --> F22N(n-way\nrepeated measures\nANOVA)
  D --> E[One]
  E --> G{How many levels?}
  G --> H[Two]
  G --> I[More than two]
  I --> J{Independent\n samples?}
  J --> K[No]
  J --> L[Yes]
  K --> S(Repeated measures one-way ANOVA\nor\nFriedman Test)
  L --> T(One way ANOVA\nor\nKruskal Wallis one-way test)
  H --> M{Independent\n samples?}
  M --> N[No]
  M --> O[Yes]
  N --> P(paired t-test\nor\nSigned rank test)
  O --> Q(two sample t-test\nor\nMatt Whitney U test)
